This is my notebook. It's a collection of notes, thoughts, and code snippets
that I've found useful.

I'm Josh. I make web hosting and web hosting accessories.

I've been working on SaaS apps since 2006 (before we called 'em "SaaS apps").
I mainly program in Ruby, PHP, and Bash.

I've written a bit about some of the [professional][] and [open source][] work
I've done. I blog sometimes over at [josh.fail][blog].

These days I lead the Software Development team at [A2 Hosting][].
